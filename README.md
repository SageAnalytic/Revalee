Scheduled callbacks for your web applications
---------------------------------------------

Revalee can simplify your web application's workflow when events are required AFTER the normal handling of a web request. You can write all of your scheduled activities in the same toolset and application as the rest of your back-end code.

Here are some common ways to utilize the power of scheduled callbacks:

*   Sending reminder email messages.
*   Running automated reports.
*   Scheduling maintenance functions.
*   Expiring accounts or subscriptions.
*   Canceling incomplete transactions.
*   Consolidating multiple notification messages.
*   Purging temporary files.
